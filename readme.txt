Borrows from techniques used in the Wrapper component of the [Editor Blocks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/editor-blocks/) plugin. Created using [Create Guten Block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block). 

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `floating-callout` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Screenshots ==

1. A blog post with a callout or sidebar area promoting a book.
2. In the editor, the post is displayed align right in approximately the same position. The placeholder banner (not displayed on the front end) makes it easier to click to select the floating content.
